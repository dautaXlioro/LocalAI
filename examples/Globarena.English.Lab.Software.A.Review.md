This may pose a challenge for some learners who do not have reliable or affordable internet access or who live in remote areas. Another limitation is that the software may not cover all the aspects of English communication that learners need or want to learn. For example, the software may not include topics such as idioms, slang, humor or cultural nuances that are important for effective communication in different contexts.
