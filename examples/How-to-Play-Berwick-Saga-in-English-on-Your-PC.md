Unfortunately, Berwick Saga was never released outside of Japan, and for a long time, there was no way for English-speaking fans to enjoy this hidden gem. However, thanks to the efforts of a dedicated fan translator named Aethin, an English patch for Berwick Saga is now available for download. This patch translates all the text in the game into English, making it fully playable and understandable for anyone who can read English.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and apply the English patch for Berwick Saga, and how to run the game on your PC using an emulator. Follow these steps and you will be able to experience one of the best tactical RPGs ever made.
 
## Step 1: Download the English Patch
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the English patch for Berwick Saga. You can find it at this link: [https://archive.org/details/berwicksagaenglishpatched](https://archive.org/details/berwicksagaenglishpatched). This is a direct download from the Internet Archive, where the translator has uploaded his work. The file name is berwicksagaenglishpatched.iso. This is an ISO file, which is an image of a CD-ROM. You will need this file to run the game on your PC.
 
## Step 2: Download an Emulator
 
The next thing you need to do is to download an emulator. An emulator is a software that allows you to run games from different consoles on your PC. For Berwick Saga, you will need a PlayStation 2 emulator. There are many PS2 emulators available online, but we recommend using PCSX2. You can download it from its official website: [https://pcsx2.net/](https://pcsx2.net/). Choose the version that matches your operating system (Windows, Linux, or Mac) and follow the instructions on how to install it.
 
## Step 3: Configure PCSX2
 
After installing PCSX2, you will need to configure it to run Berwick Saga properly. Launch PCSX2 and go to Config > Emulation Settings. Here you can adjust various settings that affect the performance and compatibility of the emulator. For Berwick Saga, we recommend using these settings:
 
- EE/IOP: Set EmotionEngine Clamping Mode to Full and VU Clamping Mode to Extra + Preserve Sign.
- VUs: Set VU0 and VU1 Recompiler Mode to MicroVU Recompiler.
- GS: Set Frame Skipping to Constant Skipping and set Frames to Draw and Frames to Skip both to 1.
- GS Window: Set Aspect Ratio to Fit to Window/Screen.
- Speedhacks: Enable MTVU (Multi-Threaded microVU1) and set EE Cyclerate and VU Cycle Stealing both to 0.
- Game Fixes: Enable Manual Game Fixes and check Enable Cheats.

You can also change other settings according to your preference, such as graphics, sound, controller, etc. For more information on how to configure PCSX2, you can check its official wiki: [https://wiki.pcsx2.net/Main\_Page](https://wiki.pcsx2.net/Main_Page).
 
## Step 4: Run Berwick Saga
 
Now you are ready to run Berwick Saga on your PC. Go to CDVD > ISO Selector > Browse and locate the berwicksagaenglishpatched.iso file that you downloaded earlier. Then go to System > Boot ISO (fast) and wait for the game to load. You should see the title screen of Berwick Saga in English.
